4. Establish quality gates and checkpoints between SDLC phases to ensure project success
5. Integrate modern tools and automation into each SDLC phase for improved efficiency

## Introduction

Imagine you're tasked with building a customer relationship management (CRM) system for a mid-sized company. Where do you start? How do you ensure the final product meets business needs? How do you coordinate between designers, developers, testers, and stakeholders? This is where the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) becomes your roadmap.

The SDLC is more than just a theoretical framework—it's a practical methodology that transforms chaotic development into a structured, predictable process. "The SDLC breaks down software development into distinct, repeatable, interdependent phases. Each phase of the SDLC has its own objectives and deliverables that guide the next phase" [1]. This structured approach reduces risks, improves quality, and ensures that everyone on the team understands what needs to happen and when.

In today's fast-paced development environment, understanding how to implement SDLC effectively is crucial for intermediate engineers. You're no longer just writing code—you're participating in the entire software creation process. You need to understand how your work fits into the bigger picture, how to collaborate across phases, and how to deliver value consistently.

This lesson focuses on the practical implementation of SDLC in real projects. We'll explore how to transition between phases, create meaningful deliverables, choose the right SDLC model for your context, and avoid common implementation pitfalls.

## Core Concept: SDLC Phases

The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) consists of seven key phases that work together to deliver quality software:

                              Back to PLANNING for next iteration
```

### Phase 1: Planning

The planning phase is the foundation of any successful software development project. Project goals, objectives, and requirements are gathered and documented during this phase [3].

**Key Deliverables:**
- Project charter with scope and objectives
- Budget and resource allocation
- Timeline with milestones
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and KPIs

**Stakeholders Involved:**
- Product managers
- Engineering leads
- Business analysts
- Executives

### Phase 2: Requirements Analysis

During this phase, the development team collects requirements from several stakeholders such as customers, internal and external experts, and managers to create a software requirement specification document [4].

**Key Deliverables:**
- Functional requirements (what the system must do)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Use case diagrams
- Requirements traceability matrix

**Example Requirements Structure:**

```
Requirement: FR-001
Description: User can search for utility provider by name
Priority: Must-have
Acceptance Criteria:
  ✓ Search returns results within 2 seconds
  ✓ Supports partial name matching
  ✓ Shows provider logo and payment methods
```

### Phase 3: Design

The design phase involves creating the architecture of the software. This includes defining the overall system architecture, database design, and user interface design [5].

**Key Deliverables:**
- System architecture diagrams
- Database schema
- API specifications
- UI/UX mockups and wireframes
- Security design
- Design review and approval

**System Architecture Example:**

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Mobile App] -->|HTTPS| B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Authentication Service]
    B --> D[Bill Payment Service]
    D --> E[Payment Gateway Adapter]
    E --> F[Utility Provider API]
    D --> G[(Database)]
    D --> H[Notification Service]
    H --> I[Email/SMS]
```

### Phase 4: Coding (Implementation)

In the coding phase, developers write the actual code based on the design documents. This phase is where the software is built, and it requires careful attention to detail [6].

**Key Activities:**
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Following coding standards and conventions
- Conducting code reviews
- Version control (Git commits, branches)
- Unit testing during development
- Documentation (inline comments, README files)

**Quality Metrics to Track:**
- Code coverage (aim for 80%+)
- Code review completion rate
- Technical debt ratio
- Linting and static analysis results

### Phase 5: Testing

Testing is a critical phase where the software is rigorously tested to identify and fix any bugs or issues [7].

**Testing Pyramid:**

```
           ┌───────────────┐
          /  Manual E2E    \  ← Few, expensive
         /    Testing       \    (~5% of tests)
        /───────────────────\
       /  Integration Tests  \  ← More tests
      /    (API, Services)    \   (~15% of tests)
     /─────────────────────────\
    /      Unit Tests           \  ← Most tests
   /   (Functions, Methods)      \   (~80% of tests)
  /───────────────────────────────\
```

**Testing Types:**
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **System Tests**: Test the complete system
- **Acceptance Tests**: Verify business requirements
- **Performance Tests**: Check speed and scalability
- **Security Tests**: Identify vulnerabilities

### Phase 6: Deployment

### 1. Skipping Phase Documentation to "Move Faster"

**The Problem:**
Teams rush through early phases thinking documentation slows them down. This creates confusion when developers don't understand requirements or testers don't know what to verify.

**The Solution:**
Create lightweight, living documentation. Use collaborative tools like Confluence or Notion that evolve with the project. Focus on essential information: what, why, and acceptance criteria. A well-written user story with clear acceptance criteria is more valuable than a 50-page requirements document no one reads [3].

**Example - Good vs. Bad Documentation:**

```
❌ BAD: "Add payment feature"

✓ GOOD:
User Story: As a customer, I want to pay utility bills through
           the app so that I can avoid late fees

Acceptance Criteria:
  - User can search for utility providers
  - System validates payment amount against balance
  - Confirmation displayed before payment submission
  - Payment completes within 3 seconds
  - Receipt generated and emailed to user

Technical Notes:
  - Integrate with existing payment gateway
  - Requires PCI DSS compliance review
  - Database schema changes in migration 2024_001
```

### 2. Treating Phases as Silos

**The Problem:**
When teams view phases as completely separate, knowledge doesn't transfer smoothly. Developers don't understand business context. Testers aren't involved until code is "done."

**The Solution:**
Implement phase overlap and cross-functional participation. Include developers in requirements discussions so they understand the "why" behind features. Involve QA engineers in design reviews to identify testability issues early [1].

**Cross-Functional Collaboration Model:**

```
Planning           ┌────────────────┐
                   │ PM + Leads     │
Requirements       └───┬────────────┘
                   ┌───▼────────────────────────┐
                   │ PM + Dev + QA + Design     │
Design             └───┬────────────────────────┘
                   ┌───▼────────────────────────┐
                   │ Dev + QA + Design          │
Implementation     └───┬────────────────────────┘
                   ┌───▼────────────────────────┐
                   │ Dev + QA                   │
Testing            └───┬────────────────────────┘
                   ┌───▼────────────────────────┐
                   │ Dev + QA + Ops             │
Deployment         └───┬────────────────────────┘
                   ┌───▼────────────────────────┐
                   │ Ops + Dev (on-call)        │
Maintenance        └────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Ignoring Feedback Loops

**The Problem:**
Some teams treat SDLC as a one-way street—once a phase is complete, they never revisit it. This rigidity leads to building the wrong thing or missing critical issues.

**The Solution:**
Build feedback loops into your process. After deployment, gather user feedback and feed it back into planning for the next iteration. When testing reveals design flaws, update the design documentation so future developers understand the rationale [1].

**Feedback Loop Integration:**

```
          ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
          │         Forward Flow                 │
          ▼                                      │
    Requirements → Design → Code → Test → Deploy
          ▲                                      │
          │         Feedback Flow                │
          └──────────────────────────────────────┘

Examples:
  - User feedback → Update requirements for next sprint
  - Test failures → Revise design documentation
  - Production errors → Improve code quality checks
  - Performance issues → Adjust architecture design
```

### 4. Inconsistent Quality Gates

**The Problem:**
Quality gates are checkpoints that ensure each phase is complete before moving to the next. Inconsistent gates lead to incomplete work being passed along, causing issues later.

**The Solution:**
Define clear exit criteria for each phase. These criteria should be specific, measurable, and agreed upon by all stakeholders [4].

**Quality Gate Examples:**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              PHASE EXIT CRITERIA                        │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                         │
│ Requirements Phase:                                     │
│   ✓ All user stories have acceptance criteria          │
│   ✓ Product owner sign-off completed                   │
│   ✓ Technical feasibility confirmed                    │
│   ✓ No critical questions unanswered                   │
│                                                         │
│ Design Phase:                                           │
│   ✓ Architecture review passed                         │
│   ✓ Security review passed                             │

│                                                         │
│ Implementation Phase:                                   │
│   ✓ Code coverage >= 80%                               │
│   ✓ All code reviews approved                          │
│   ✓ No critical or high-severity bugs                  │
│   ✓ Static analysis passed                             │
│                                                         │
│ Testing Phase:                                          │
│   ✓ All test cases executed                            │
│   ✓ No P0 or P1 bugs open                              │
│   ✓ Performance benchmarks met                         │
│   ✓ Security scan passed                               │
│                                                         │
